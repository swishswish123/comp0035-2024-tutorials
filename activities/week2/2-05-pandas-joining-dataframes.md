# Activity 2.5: Joining dataframes

In the medal_standings DataFrame there is a field called 'NPC' which contains the three-letter codes used by the
National Paralympic Committee (NPC) to describe a team. The teams are usually countries such as "China", or a construct,
such as "Neutral Para Athletes".

A list of all the current and historic NPC codes is the data file `tutorialpkg/data/npc_codes.csv` (the Excel version
has
the same data).

It may be useful in our later analysis to indicate the NPC code for each of the paralympic events, so this activity
looks at how you can join data from one dataframe to another.

To join the data from two dataframes, there needs to be a column that is common to both. In this case:

- `npc_codes.csv` : "Name"
- `paralympics_events` : "country"

"Name" and "country" both appear to contain the country name.

There are two methods for combining data using pandas:

- To combine two dataframes with a common index or key column (i.e. a column with unique values only) you can
  use [pandas.DataFrame.join()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.join.html?highlight=join#pandas.DataFrame.join):
- To combine two dataframes where the common column is not an index or key then you
  use [pandas.DataFrame.merge()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html?highlight=merge#pandas.DataFrame.merge)
  .

In this case "country" appears several times in the events data so 'merge' is needed.

There are different methods to combine data. These are:

- left: use calling frame’s index (or column if one is specified)
- right: use other's index.
- outer: form a union of calling frame's index (or column if on is specified) with other's index, and sort it
  lexicographically.
- inner: form intersection of calling frame's index (or column if on is specified) with other's index, preserving the
  order of the calling’s one.
- cross: creates the cartesian product from both frames, preserves the order of the left keys.

Start with the 'events' dataframe which is the one you want to add the 'NPC' column to. This has 32 rows. This is the '
left' dataframe.

The 'right' dataframe is the npc_codes. This has 132 rows.

Using the different methods to combine the data:

- left: the resulting dataframe would add the NPC code to the 'events'. The result will be 32 rows.
- right: the resulting DataFrame will have 132 rows (same as the 'npc_codes' DataFrame). This is because a right join
  includes all rows from the right DataFrame and matches rows from the left DataFrame based on the join key. If there
  are no matching rows in the left DataFrame, the result will contain NaN for those columns.
- outer: the resulting DataFrame will include all unique rows from both DataFrames. This means it forms the union of the
  columns ('Name', 'country') from both DataFrames. The exact number of rows in the resulting DataFrame depends on the
  overlap between the columns of the two DataFrames.
- inner: the resulting DataFrame will only include rows that have matching columns in both DataFrames. The number of
  rows in the resulting DataFrame depends on the overlap between the columns of the two DataFrames. If there is no
  overlap, the resulting DataFrame will have 0 rows. If there is complete overlap, the resulting DataFrame will have the
  same number of rows as the smaller DataFrame.
- cross: if the left DataFrame has 32 rows and the right DataFrame has 132 rows, the resulting DataFrame will have: 32 *
  132 = 4224 rows.

You need to use the 'left' method in this case.

Of the available parameters in the merge function:
`DataFrame.merge(right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, right_index=False, sort=False, suffixes=('_x', '_y'), copy=None, indicator=False, validate=None)`

You need to specify the following:

`left_dataframe_name.merge(right_dataframe_name, how='left', left_on='col_name_in_left_df', right_on='col_name_in_right_df')`

1. Decide where to add code to merge the two dataframes. You can add this to the data preparation function, and add a
   second parameter
   so you can pass both dataframes, or you could just add to the 'main' for ease in this tutorial.
2. Open the npc_codes.csv into a DataFrame, reading in just the 'Name' and the 'Code' columns as we only need these.
   The parameter `usecols=['Code', 'Name']` for the pd.read_csv function is useful here.

   Note: there is a problematic character somewhere in the npc_codes.csv file. You can read the file using the
   additional parameters from this example:
   `df = pd.read_csv(path_to_npc_csv_file, encoding='utf-8', encoding_errors='ignore', usecols=['col1', 'col2'])`
3. Add the code to 'merge' the two dataframes and create a new merged dataframe with the result.
4. Print the 'country', 'Code', 'Name' columns from the merged dataframe.

The print should look something like this:

```text
        country Code         Name
0         Italy  ITA        Italy
1         Japan  JPN        Japan

18       Sweden  SWE       Sweden
19       Norway  NOR       Norway
20      Austria  AUT      Austria
21      Austria  AUT      Austria
22       France  FRA       France
23       Norway  NOR       Norway
24        Japan  JPN        Japan
25          USA  NaN          NaN
26        Italy  ITA        Italy
27       Canada  CAN       Canada
28       Russia  NaN          NaN
29        Korea  NaN          NaN
30        China  NaN          NaN
31        Italy  ITA        Italy
```

We have lots of 'NaN's. Why?

To match the values in the columns 'country' and 'Name' needed to be identical. Unfortunately, countries often have different ways of spelling, so for example UK in the events, and United Kingdom in the NPC.

Dealing with NaNs and Nulls is covered in a later activity.
